Welcome to 812! This laboratory is a family full of joy!

<!--more-->

The **812 Research Group**  is led by Professor Yu Zhu, the team is committed to the research of Computer Vision, including Medical Imaging, Autonomous Driving, Deepfake, Image Superresolution, NERF, Expression Recognition etc. 

Here Leads to sub-pages and main links of our laboratory.

- Research Introduction
  - Medical images : Two PhD students([Xiaoben Jiang](https://ecust812.netlify.app/author/xiaoben-jiang-%E8%92%8B%E6%99%93%E5%A5%94/) and [Yatong Liu](https://ecust812.netlify.app/author/yatong-liu-%E5%88%98%E9%9B%85%E7%AB%A5/)) and several master students are researching in this area.
  - Autonomous driving: One PhD student([Ziming Zhu](https://ecust812.netlify.app/author/ziming-zhu-%E6%9C%B1%E6%A2%93%E9%93%AD/)) and one master student are researching in this area.
  - Nerf: One PhD student([Hangyu Li](https://ecust812.netlify.app/author/hnagyu-li-%E6%9D%8E%E8%88%AA%E5%AE%87/)) and one master are researching in this area.
  - Deepfake, Image Super-resolution, Facial Expression Recognition etc.

In early Nov, 6 new 3090 GPUs has been arrived, till now, our laboratory has extremely abundant computing resources. Wish the students in the lab publish more papers!
