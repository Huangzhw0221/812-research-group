Shunbo Dai was born in Xiangyang, Hubei Province, China in 1998. His research interests include medical image processing in deep learning and computer vision. Graduated from East China University of Science and Technology with a master's degree in 2023.

During his graduate studies, he published an SCI paper on Neurocomputing. He was awarded the honorary title of East China University of Science and Technology's Outstanding Graduate in 2023, and twice won the East China University of Science and Technology's Outstanding Student and Academic First-Class Scholarships.

Hobbies: Music (he occasionally sings), table tennis (I heard his skills are not bad, who knows)

Real people are crazy. In his view, study and work are just one point, but life is all aspects. In addition to scientific research, he enjoys the immediate beauty of life, with a pair of eyes that discover beauty and a mood full of expectations. I hope you can be like him, love life and capture the beauty.

Currently employed at Advantest.
